          <td><p>Kirkland Organic Soymilk Plain is not exactly plain. Besides just the main ingredients soybean and water, it also contains <strong>Organic Cane Sugar</strong>, <strong>Tricalcium Phosphate</strong>, <strong>Salt</strong>, <strong>Carageenan</strong>, <strong>Organic Vanilla Flavor</strong> as well as other "natural flavors". The additional ingredients in this soy milk does not make it conducive for a lot of the wonderful recipes and products that can be made from soy. Kirkland is the only brand we review here which has a list of ingredients beyond just soy + water. Some of the other well-known brands we know of that have other ingredients are: Silk, Soy Dream, Lucerne SoyMilk, Better Than Milk (amongst others)</p></td>

          <td><p>EdenSoy is quite delicious. It tastes creamier than some of the other brands but this is not because it has extra ingredients. Rather, it simply has a higher density of soybean to water ratio. It is sealed in the cardboard box and has a long enough shelf-life to be carried in Grocery Store. The only thing that you won't get with this brand of Soy Milk is the fresh beany taste that is enjoyed in many recipes.</p></td>

Taste-wise, they have the delicious and familiar taste that many Asian daily cuisine require. Also, the <a href="#">Yuba</a> and other savory products they can produce are that familiar bean flavor that is enjoyed by so many around the world.</p></td>
